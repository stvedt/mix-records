  <h2 class="caption red"><em>&quot;level of expression and creation&quot;</em></h2>
    <p class="caption">Mix is also very involved with music perfromance as well as music production. We also embrace performance and production to be one in the same. As performance adds a level of expression and creation one may not find in a traditional music production workflow. As traditional musicians are performers and talented instrumentalists our artists are very talented musicians as well. They are just very good and controlling a mix and manipulating all aspects of song be it the bass  line, creating a build or even a roll. They are good at doing so and have the knowledge of song structure and music theory that any good producer should.</p>
